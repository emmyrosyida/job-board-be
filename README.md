# Job Board Platform BE (Scenario 1)

This project provides a GraphQL API for managing job listings, built using AWS AppSync, MongoDB, and Lambda functions. The API is designed to be scalable, serverless, and easy to use.

## Features
- Create, update, delete, and retrieve job listings.
- Update the status of a job (e.g., active, deleted, draft).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Node.js and yarn installed

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`.
3. Configure your AWS credentials and environment (e.g., using environment variables or AWS profiles).
4. Deploy the project: `yarn deploy` (eg: `yarn deploy:prod` for production).
5. Run the project locally: `yarn dev`.
6. Test the project API: `yarn test`.

## Usage
Once deployed, you can interact with the API using any GraphQL client (e.g., Insomnia). 
The API endpoint can be found in the `Insomnia_2024-05-24.json`.
